## supervised learning
Examples are given that include the "right answer" (label `y` for input `x`). Machine learns to deduce label `y` over time.
- spam detection
- speech recognition
- machine translation
- online advertising
- self-driving cars

- spam vs. not spam
- cancer vs. benign

May be non-binary, and can be non-numeric.
