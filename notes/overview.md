## supervised learning
Examples are given that include the "right answer" (label `y` for input `x`). Machine learns to deduce label `y` over time.
- spam detection
- speech recognition
- machine translation
- online advertising
- self-driving cars
- visual inspection

### regression
Prediction of a value from a continuum (e.g. value of commodity).

### classificaiton
Prediction of classification into finite (discrete, non-continuous) _class_ (or _category_).
- spam vs. not spam
- cancer vs. benign

May be non-binary, and can be non-numeric. 

## unsupervised learning
No output labels are provided, only inputs `x`. Algorithm is responsible for finding structure in the data.  

### clustering
- related news articles
- DNA sequences
- customer segmentation

### anomaly detection
- fraud detection

### dimensionality reduction
Compression. 

## reinforcement learning
(Not covered.)
